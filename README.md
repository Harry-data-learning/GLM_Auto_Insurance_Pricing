# GLM_Auto_Insurance_Pricing
This is a GLM modeling project for auto insurance pricing

This project is designed to help me learn and implement a GLM-based auto insurance pricing model from scratch (0 to 1).
The model is built for a fictional insurance company, X Insurance, using synthetic data.
It is designed for comprehensive auto insurance, covering all states and all vehicle types.
The final output of this model will be used as an input for X Insuranceâ€™s pricing system to estimate insurance premiums based on modeled claim frequency and severity.
